<h2>Music</h2>
<h3>Taste:</h3>
<p>Some of my earliest influences for music come from rap, metal, dubstep, and pop. Over the years, <br>
my taste has developed, and I can no longer keep track of all the genres and sub-genres. Instead of <br>
listing them, I will share a few of my favorite artists. They are: Metallica, Slipknot, System of a Down,<br>
   Lil Wayne, Tyler the Creator, Kid Cudi, Xavier Wulf, Chris Travis, Playboi Carti, Depeche Mode, The Smiths,<br>
Agent Orange, and Dead Mau5. Just to name a few. Here are some of their album covers:</p>

<h3>Sources:</h3>
<p> My first personal music device was an iPod nano that my dad gave me for Christmas. He was able to brainwash<br>
me with his musical taste this way. These days, I use various apps on my phone. My preferred source is Sound Cloud.<br>
    <a href="https://soundclound.com">Sound Cloud</a> has been responsible for the popularization of countless underground artists over the years, and <br>
that is why I love it so much. I like to keep things fresh, and they help me out with that!</p>
