<h3>Where it Started:</h3>
<p>     The first time I rode a bike for a non-transportational purpose  in my neighborhood at the age <br>
of four. My dad took me to a small track next to me school. Looking back, I was incredibly lucky <br>
to have something so cool in my neighborhood. This track would become my home over the next eight <br>
years. Sometime after I turned eight, I started racing BMX competitively. I would travel all over <br>
the country with a great team of kids, and it was a lot of fun. However, I was more interested in <br>
catching air and doing tricks. My first freestyle bike came when I was about ten years old, but I <br>
continued racing until I was fourteen. Once I got on that freestyle bike I knew I was never getting <br>
off. It has been more than ten years and I still cannot get enough of it.</p>
<h3>Influence:</h3>
<p>The first rider I ever looked up to is Aaron Ross. His part in the "Chill Bro" DVD was legendary and <br>
inspired me the instant I saw it. Today, my favorite riders are Simone Barraco, Mark Burnett, and <br>
    Devon Smillie. </p>

<h3>Goals:</h3>
<p> I have always dreamed of riding professionally, but now that I am entering my twenties my priorities <br>
 are starting to shift. I still intend to push myself, but if I can simply capture my progress on <br>
 film, then I will have all the accolades I want.
