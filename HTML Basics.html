<h1>First Portfolio Project</h1>
<p> Hello, and welcome to my first HTML/CSS project. <br>
Hopefully, I can make this impressive enough to land a job at your company!
</p>

<h2> About Me</h2>

<h3> Career: </h3>

<p> My name is Brody Denton, and I am a 20 year old junior developer from Austin, Texas.
    <br> I have been programming for about three years inconsistently. However, I am now trying to <br>
    make a career out of it.
<h3> Interests: </h3>
<h4>Bikes </h4>
<p>I have a few hobbies, but my favorite one is freestyle BMX. <br>
    Here is a video of me riding! :<a href="https://youtu.be/SWb9abMGkZ8">Me on a bike</a> <br>
Feel free to visit my BMX Page! <a href="AboutBikes.html"> There</a> , you can find  <br>
    out more about how I started and where I am taking it. <br>
I mostly just ride bikes, but I also love playing tennis. Tennis is definitely my second <br>
passion, but I wish I started playing before high school.</p>
<h4>Music </h4>
<p class="music" > I also love to listen to music! I spend hours listening to my favorite songs <br>
and finding new ones. My <a href="About Music.html"> music page</a> has some of my favorite artists <br>
as well as where you can go to listen to them.
</p>
<h3>Goals:</h3>
    <p>My main objective in life is to avoid complacency. I want to continue improving for as long <br>
    as I live. However, I know that one day I want to pass on what I have learned. I have thoughts <br>
    of becoming a public school teacher, but, as of now, that requires a degree. Maybe I can find <br>
    another outlet for my desire to pass the torch.</p>
